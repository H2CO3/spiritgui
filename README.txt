Still using Spirit to jailbreak your iPhone/iPad on iOS 3.2 or lower? You're even using Linux but you're unfamiliar with the command line? (not likely, but) If so, here's a quick GUI for Spirit. Anyways, you'll need to type make to make this ;-)
Best used with posixninja/spirit-linux (you'lll be able to figure out, how, I promise).
This is just a quick hack, but I thought it would be great to start learning GTK+ by making a GUI for this jailbreak...
Oh, and license:
